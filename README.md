## A Free Tabletop RPG Character Builder

This is a little hobby project I started out of the frustration of finding that the current Tabletop RPG Character builder offerings on the market to were... -we'll say, "less than useful". For the amount that many of these TTRPG Character builders ask players to pay, I feel they either miss out on a lot, or nickel and dime the hell out of you in order to get satisfactory functionality. I also feel they lack the kinds of customization options that my TTRPG group needed for our campaigns with use a bit of homebrew. This is just a fun little coding project to hopefully alleviate some of those frustrations for myself.
