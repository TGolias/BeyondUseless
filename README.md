A Free Tabletop RPG Character Builder

This is a little hobby project I started out of the frustration of finding that the current Tabletop RPG Character builder offerings on the market to were... -we'll say, "less than useful" and "price gouging". For the amount of money these TTRPG Character builders asked for, I felt they missed out on helpful features and reminders while playing. I also felt they lacked the kinds of customization options the my TTRPG group needed for our heavily homebrewed campaign. I'd like to some day get this tool to that point, but I gotta crawl before I can walk.
